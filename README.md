tubestampprod is the the first attempt at a fullstack application from Ken following the tutorial of Softwware Engineering YouTube Corbin Brown from the YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvquJI-v8ys&list=PLJrzt4ameiaMxmOwTlxOy3eW37oZgAMIw

## Demo Video

<!-- Add your video file to the public/videos/ directory, then update the path below -->

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/your-user-id/your-video-id.mp4

**Alternative options:**
- Add video to `public/videos/` and use raw GitHub link: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/tubestampprod/main/public/videos/demo.mp4`
- Upload via GitHub's drag-and-drop interface in issues/PRs to get a `user-images.githubusercontent.com` link (recommended for best compatibility)
- Use an external hosting service (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.) and embed with an iframe

> **Tip:** For best results on GitHub, keep video files under 10MB and use MP4 format.

This repository contains all the code which produced the UX/UI on the frontend as well as the backend functions including uses the off the shelf YouTube APIs from Google and Bumpups API from Corbin Brown. 

In this project, I developed skills connecting the frontend React (JavaScript & CSS), backend Firebease & Google Cloud Platform (GCP), altogether and safely developing the code with stable version control GitHub. I also learned how to leverage third party API tools from YouTube API and the main value provider Bumpups with is the custom code that generates the timestamps and its Bumpups API. I developed lots of confidence in prompt engineering skills and how to code alongside an AI partner as well as some limitation of AI. Other learning include the importance of security in API keys and safely storing high risk variables and specifically using the FontAwesome icon library.

Overall, this project taught me a lot about software development, client facing software, Software as a Service (SaaS) and how this could be leverage through the development of AI in the next decade - especially the business side of things was incredibly interesting. 

Building on from this product I would expand by enabling Google AdSense and user authentication through RECAPTCHA as well as learning to develop my own custom toolkit which provides the user value.
